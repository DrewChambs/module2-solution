              <p>Change is good and I think of or store its data this way.
                Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a series
                of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git,
                every time you commit, or save the state of your
                project, Git basically takes a picture of what all
                your files look like at that moment and stores a
                reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if
                files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file
                again, just a link to the previous identical file
                it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more
                like a stream of snapshots.
